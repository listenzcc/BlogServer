# Speed-up Pandas Query with Regular Expression

The **two steps** method can improve the speed performance of pandas query.
The 1st is to **narrow** the range, the 2nd is to **find** the matching using **re**.
The matching using re is also speeded up by **precompiling**.

## Keywords

python, pandas, re, speedup

## Method

In my pinYin input method, a large pandas data frame has been generated.
The job is to find the pinYins using **re** matching to achieve **vague matching**.

A **two steps** method is used to speed up the process.

1. Narrow down the range by selecting the pinYins starting with the character;
2. Find the matched pinYins using **re** to achieve **vague matching**.
- Additionally, the matching process is also faster using **precompiled** re object.

## Example Code

```python
# Related Variables
# - @pinYin: The inputted pinYin fragment
# - @re: The re package
# - @pinYin_table: The data frame of pinYin(chars)-ciZu(words in chinese) dataset,
#                  with the columns of ['pinYin', 'ciZus']

# Makeup and Compile the re,
# for vague matching
p = '.*'.join(pinYin)
p = p + '.*'
r = re.compile(p)

# 1st step, filter the pinYins startswith p[0]
found = self.pinYin_table[self.pinYin_table['pinYin'].map(
lambda e: e.startswith(p[0]))]

# 2nd step, re matching
if len(found) > 0:
found = found[found['pinYin'].map(lambda e: match(r, e))]
```
