# Transfer Variables and Throw Errors

The main concern of programming is how to transfer variables safely and throw errors at the right time.

## Keywords

Programming,

## Method

For common practice, the program requires three kinds of things:
1. User input variables;
2. Read files from disk;
3. Connection from net devices.

Since the variables can be mismatched or completely wrong,
the necessary protection is required.

My plan is checking the input at the very input,
after that the variables will be treated as absolutely correct.
The errors will be raised at the same time.
