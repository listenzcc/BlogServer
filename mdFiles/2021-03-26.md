# Server Issue

The manual of managing computation server.
Commonly, there is a cluster that are made by several machines running Linux.
The script shows how to build the system.

## Keywords

Linux, Cluster

## Methods

There are lots of issues to be solved to build a fully functional cluster system.
The following will organize the things as their functions.

### Network

The part shows how to connect the machines through network.
Basically, the common hosts name space is used to let them know each other.
And the ssh pipeline is used to form them to communicate.

Here shows how.

### Authentication

Since there are several machines,
the best way for the user's authentication information is to be stored in one machine,
and others will used it for users to login.

Here shows how.

### Storage

The machines need a common storage space, or a storage system.
Or, one has to write or read his/her data in multiple possible locations.
It can be a disaster.
To prevent this, a NFS is required.

Here shows how.

### Softwares

The machines finally work as a whole.
Just install your amazing software to **ALL of THEM** for your job.

Here shows how.

### PBS

Last but not least,
if you don't want the users locate their jobs across the whole cluster.
You can use PBS to automatically manage them.

Here shows how.
