# Conda Messes CMD in Win10

My anaconda messes my CMD, by putting wrong startup command into the regedit.

## Keywords

Anaconda, Window10

## What happened

I re-installed the anaconda on the fucking shinning day.

After installation, I run

```powershell
conda init
```

to startup the conda environment.

Then, I found everything in my build is messed up.
The cmd always complain about there are not supposed to be a "&" symbol.
As a result, all the commands using the cmd is dead.

Finally, I find out the reason is the conda has changed the regedit key of

> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun

into

> if exist & if exist

It is definitely wrong.
After delete the bug string.
Everything is just fine.

## My Mistake

I admit I was wrong to run the command, the correct command should be

```powershell
conda init powershell
```

or

```powershell
conda init cmd.exe
```

to install the anaconda environment in Win10.

## My Question

My question is in two folders,

1. Why the anaconda messes my regedit key like that?
2. Why can't I reproduce the bug after that?

Can anyone help?

## My Advice

If your cmd is broken too in the future, you can check the regedit for a quick debug.
