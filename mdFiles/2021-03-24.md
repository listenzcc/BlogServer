# Reshape in Numpy

The array is a series of numbers, characters or something similar.
It can also be with multiple dimensions.
The numpy package provides **reshape** method for converting the array from different dimensions.
The article shows how the numbers are ordered during the reshaping.

## Description

When reshape is applied to the 1-D series,
it is converted into higher dimensions.
The order is following the rules:

1. The elements in the raw series are filled to new multiple-dimension tensor one-by-one;
2. The latest dimension is filled first;
3. And so on.

```python
# For example, there are 24 numbers, from 0 to 23.
# 1-D series
arr1 = np.array([e for e in range(24)])
print('Arr1:', arr1)

# 3-D tensor
arr3 = arr1.reshape((2, 3, 4))
print('Arr2:', arr3)

'''
Output is
Arr1:
[ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23]

Arr2:
[[[ 0  1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6  7]
  [ 8  9 10 11]]

 [[12 13 14 15]
  [16 17 18 19]
  [20 21 22 23]]]
