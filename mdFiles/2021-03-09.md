# Showdown Formula using KaTeX

Making the markdown explainer render the formula like LaTeX.
I am installing the NodeJS package of KaTeX support as a showdown extension.

JavaScript, NodeJS, KaTeX, Showdown, To-do

## Method

It is somehow too difficult to apply the showdown extension of katex,
since it can only be applied using NodeJS backends,
which is not compatible for python script.

But, it seems to be the easiest way to make the showdown renders the formula as a LaTeX does.

The document can be found in [https://katex.org/docs/node.html](https://katex.org/docs/node.html).
